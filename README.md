## Project Ideas

- Accumulation of resources increases probability of being chosen to do work
- If chosen to do work, you have the option of doing what is requested, or _misbehaving_
- Completing work gets you a reward
- _Misbehaving_ might get you more of a reward
- _Misbehaving_ might get you a punishment
- Punishment is reduction of resources
- Whether you get punished or not is dependent on the number of _players_ watching you
- If you own `>50%` of the resources, you can _misbehave_ without punishment, provided there is only _one_ player watching you

Intern at freeCodeCamp in our server room. Help debug this VM. Improve it, or introduce more bugs. If you introduce **any** jQuery, you have _definitely_ misbehaved

- Resources
  - Money to purchase skillsets. Buy Nodejs Course... Buy jQuery course to misbehave
  - Reputation - trust - watched less closely by nodes. Higher rep === more work
- Mechanics
  - Walk to VM to do tasks
- Tasks
  - Quiz
  - Solve algorithm
- Text based, MMO, or simple boxes/rooms to click
